Simple repo for configuring work environment

## What it does
Installs programs often used in my work environment, like Google-Chrome, Iterm2 and shell extensions.

## Todo
* Split into two main tasks. One for programs and one for more specific work environment
* Use downloads folder for scripts downloading every time (like zsh)
* Configure shell with autocomplete like [here](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/iTerm/zsh.html)
* Set up Java
* Set up environment variables
